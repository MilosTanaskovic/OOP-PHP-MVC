////// Object Oriented PHP & MVC Project without framworks //////

// This is NOT a beginner based PHP project
// We will be building a custom MVC framework from the ground up 
// Once the framework is complete, we will build an app on top of it.
// There will be an OPP primer section before starting the project.

// Completely open source, can it what you want.
// Will include full MVC workflow
// Will use .htaccess and mod_rewrite for friendly URLs
// Will have a base controller to load models & views
// Will have a database library class that uses PDO 

// Post Sharing Social App built on the custom framework
// Will include full user authentication & access control
// Will include full CRUD functionality for post 
// Will include extra helpers for things like redirecting and flash messaging
// We will deploy our app to shared hosting at the end.
// We will start with creating the framework itself and move to creating an app with the framework.
