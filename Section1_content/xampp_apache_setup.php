   Apache Friends is a non-profit project to promote the Apache web server and is home to the XAMPP project. XAMPP is an easy to install Apache distribution containing MariaDB, PHP, and Perl.

   go to: Windows(C:) -> xampp -> htdocs and create test folder with index page (test -> index.php)

8. Run phpmyadmin -> localhost/phpmyadmin/
9. if we want to change password from database we can do it. 
 go to User account -> database and change password. When we've done it, and if we want to open Database, it won't be able to do. we lost access for it. don't wory.
 10. go to WindowsC -> xampp -> phpMyAdmin -> config.inc.php and put a new password. save it and return back on the phpadmin page and reload it again. it should be work.
